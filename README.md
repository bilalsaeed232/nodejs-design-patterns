# NodeJS Design Patterns
13 most common object oriented design patterns as applied to node.js projects

## Chain of Responsibility
The Chain of Responsibility pattern provides a chain of loosely coupled objects one of which can satisfy a request. This pattern is essentially a linear search for an object that can handle a particular request.

An example of a chain-of-responsibility is event-bubbling in which an event propagates through a series of nested controls one of which may choose to handle the event.
